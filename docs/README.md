# Scale Institutional Knowledge Using Copilot Spaces

Welcome to the OctoAcme knowledge base! This repository is designed to help you share, update, and centralize institutional knowledge using Copilot Spaces.

## Project Management at OctoAcme

OctoAcme follows a structured, collaborative approach to project management, ensuring clarity, efficiency, and continuous improvement. Hereâ€™s a brief overview:

### Principles
- **Customer-first:** Prioritize customer value and usability.
- **Iterative delivery:** Deliver small, testable increments.
- **Clear ownership:** Each project has a named Project Manager (PM) and Product Lead.
- **Data-informed decisions:** Measure impact and iterate based on evidence.
- **Psychological safety:** Encourage feedback and learning.

### Core Roles
- **Project Manager (PM):** Coordinates delivery, schedules, risk, communications.
- **Product Manager (PdM):** Defines outcomes, prioritizes backlog, and measures success.
- **Developers:** Implement features, collaborate on design and testability.
- **QA/Testing:** Validate quality and acceptance criteria.
- **Stakeholders:** Provide inputs and approvals.

### Key Artifacts
- Project Charter / One-pager
- Roadmap and Release Plan
- Sprint/Iteration Backlog
- Acceptance Criteria & Definition of Done
- Risk Register
- Retrospective notes and action items

### Lifecycle
1. **Initiation:** Problem statement, stakeholders, high-level timeline.
2. **Planning:** Scope, resources, milestones, dependencies.
3. **Execution:** Build, test, review, iterate.
4. **Release:** Deploy, verify, announce.
5. **Close & Retrospective:** Capture learnings and next steps.

### Communication Cadence
- Weekly sync between PM + PdM
- Twice-weekly standups for delivery team (or as agreed)
- Monthly stakeholder updates
- Ad-hoc escalations as needed

### How to Use These Docs
- Keep the Project Charter updated in the project repo.
- Add process-specific docs into `.copilot/` if you want Copilot Spaces to use them as context.
